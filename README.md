# Mattermost ADFS Edition

Mattermost is an open source, self-hosted Slack-alternative. 

This is a modified version of the March 16, 2016 stable release v2.1.0.
The version adds an additional compenent to integrates with ADFS for SSO.

I have called it v2.1.1.

You can either download the compiled version from the release tab or compile it yourself. I used version 1.5.1 Golang to compile it.
Please avoid 1.4.2 golang as there where some issues
